        <p class="lead mb-5 text-white" style = "font-size: 1rem;"> &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp The ALARMO 9000 is a smart alarm clock embedded system which aims to improve the user's overall quality of life through the use of sleep monitoring and real-time updates. The project was started on November 2017 and was completed as of December 2017. Together with 2 other students, Kevin Chik (CE) and Daniel Kim (CE), we successfully planned, designed and developed the final product which was demoed to professors and TA's in the ECE deparment. </p>

      <p class="lead mb-5 text-white" style = "font-size: 1rem;"> <br/> &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp From a high level perspective, the alarm clock had several key functions that it would perform. The first being its ability to record the amount of sleep the user recieves per night and in doing so, it provides details about the user's sleeping patterns and gives advice on how they should improve. The second function for the alarm clock was to allow it to access the internet and every morning when the user wakes up, it will relay important information to the user such as weather, news, etc. And the last and arguably most important function of the smart alarm clock system would be to have all the basic functionalities of a regular alarm clock. This would include snooze buttons, the ability to set an alarm and a real-time clock. <br/> <br/> 

      &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp As the team lead and hardware designer, I was in charge of both the software and hardware architecture that went into the product. I distributed tasks and kept in check with group members to ensure a timely delivery date. I wrote the gpio drivers to control hardware peripherals such as the LCD display and LED lighting system and ensured that they were compatible with the embedded Linux system. I also designed and implemented all the circuitry which spanned from simple push buttons to external WiFi and sound modules. </p>
