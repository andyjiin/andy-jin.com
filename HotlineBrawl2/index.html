        <p class="lead mb-5 text-white" style = "font-size: 1rem;"> &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp Hotline Brawl 2 is a networked top-down shooter game built entirely in Java where you can play as your favourite Nintendo character against your friends. The object of the game is to kill other players in order to upgrade weapons with each weapon being progressively harder to use. The games artwork from individual sprites to game objects such as bullets and maps were done by hand on Adobe Photoshop. The project began October 2016 and was completed as of Janurary 2017. Note: There is no Hotline Brawl 1 we just called it number 2 for no particular reason :) </p>

        <p class="lead mb-5 text-white" style = "font-size: 1rem;"> <br/> The final release of the project included features such as panning camera, customizable maps, networked servers, projectile physics, collision detection and detailed GUI. Being my second game design project, I focused on including more features and modularized all game objects so it focused in on the object-oriented side of game programming. </p>

        <p class="lead mb-5 text-white" style = "font-size: 1rem;"> <br/> Some problems that we faced during development was the fact that our processor could not handle a large number of game objects on screen especially while hosting many clients. Our original solution was to set an upper limit to where no more game objects can appear on the screen. This is a common game programming practice back when games could handle a lot less but although it helped improve our FPS, the game could still only support a maximum of 4 players (give or take a few depending on the type of computer). Looking back, a simple solution to this problem could be to incorporate multithreading so that game processes could run in parallel with each other. </p>
